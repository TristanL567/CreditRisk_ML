GLM ELASTIC NET RESULTS SUMMARY
================================

Analysis Date: 2026-01-16

1. HYPERPARAMETER TUNING COMPARISON
-----------------------------------
Grid Search (11 alphas):     CV AUC = 0.8020, alpha = 1.0000
Random Search (10 alphas):   CV AUC = 0.8020, alpha = 0.9513
Bayesian Optim (13 alphas):  CV AUC = 0.8022, alpha = 0.9976

WINNER: Bayesian Optimization (by 0.0002 AUC margin)

IMPORTANT: All methods achieved CV AUC ≈ 0.802 (tied when rounded to 3 decimals)

2. CHAMPION MODEL CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------
Optimal Alpha: 0.9976
  - Interpretation: LASSO-heavy (L1 penalty dominant) - aggressive feature selection

Optimal Lambda (min): 0.0000503
Optimal Lambda (1se): 0.0000654

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Cross-Validation AUC: 0.8022 (5-fold stratified)
Training AUC:         0.8040
Test AUC (Champion):  0.79227
Test AUC (1-SE Rule): 0.79152

Performance Gap: 1.17% drop from train to test
  - Interpretation: Excellent generalization - minimal overfitting

4. FEATURE SELECTION
-------------------
Features in Champion Model (lambda.min): 21 out of 24
Features in Parsimonious Model (lambda.1se): 14 out of 24
Features Eliminated: 3

5. INTERPRETATION
-----------------
AUC Score Meaning:
  - 0.50 = Random guessing (coin flip)
  - 0.70-0.80 = Acceptable discrimination
  - 0.80-0.90 = Excellent discrimination
  - >0.90 = Outstanding discrimination

Your Test AUC of 0.79 means: Acceptable model - decent predictive power

6. DATASET BALANCE
-----------------
Train Set:
  • Observation-level default rate: 0.91%
  • Firm-level default rate: 2.76%
  • Total Firms: 51,091
  • Total Observations: 158,764

Test Set:
  • Observation-level default rate: 0.90%
  • Firm-level default rate: 2.75%
  • Total Firms: 21,890
  • Total Observations: 68,233

Stratification Quality: Excellent (default rates nearly identical)

7. SECTOR ANALYSIS
-----------------
Highest Risk Sectors:
  1. Manufacture: 3.52% default rate
  2. Retail: 3.35% default rate
  3. Service: 3.30% default rate

Lowest Risk Sectors:
  1. Energy: 0.83% default rate
  2. Real Estate: 1.74% default rate

9. NEXT STEPS
-------------
1. Review feature coefficients to understand which predictors drive default risk
2. Investigate which features were eliminated (coefficient = 0)
3. Compare against tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for potential improvement
4. Consider calibration analysis if using for probability estimates
5. Validate model stability over time (temporal validation)

10. KEY INSIGHTS
---------------
✓ All three tuning methods converged to high α values (≥ 0.59), confirming LASSO's superiority for this problem
✓ CV AUC plateau at 0.802 suggests linear models may have hit performance ceiling
✓ Excellent train-test consistency (gap < 2%) indicates robust generalization
✓ Sparse solution (14-21 features) provides good interpretability
✗ Test AUC below 0.80 threshold - consider ensemble methods for improvement

RECOMMENDATION:
Use the Parsimonious Model (14 features, AUC = 0.79152) for production deployment.
Only 0.075 AUC sacrifice vs. champion, but 33% fewer features = easier maintenance,
lower data pipeline risk, and better stakeholder explainability.
